----
git clone git@github.com:Konnektoren/konnektoren-web-game.git
----

then compile and serve the page with

[source,bash]
----
trunk serve
----

then visit http://localhost:8080

== Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

* `docs/` contains the developer guide
* `src/` contains the source code
* `src/assets/challenges/` contains the challenge assets
* `src/assets/i18n/` contains the internationalization assets
* `styles/` contains the scss styles
* `Cargo.toml` contains the package metadata
* `README.adoc` contains the project documentation

== Contributing

To contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes
4. Push your changes to your fork
5. Open a pull request

== Level Design

The levels are defined in the `src/assets/challenges/levels.yml` file. Each level has a unique identifier and contains a list of challenges. The challenges are defined in separate YAML files in the `src/assets/challenges/` directory.

[source,yaml]
----
include::../src/assets/challenges/level_a1.yml[lines=1..20]
----

This structure allows for a modular and flexible level design. The main levels file references individual challenge files, making it easy to add, remove, or modify challenges without affecting the overall level structure.

=== Tasks

Each challenge consists of a task that the user must complete. The task can be a text-based question, a multiple-choice question, or a custom challenge. The challenge configuration defines the type, content, and parameters of the task.

[source,yaml]
----
challenges:
  - id: "articles-1"
    name: "Artikel 1"
    description: "Choose the correct article for the following nouns"
    challenge: "articles-info"
    variant: "informative-markdown"
    tasks: 1
    unlock_points: 0
    position: [2, 2]
----

Key components of a challenge configuration:

1. `id`: A unique identifier for the challenge.
2. `name`: The display name of the challenge.
3. `description`: A brief explanation of what the user needs to do.
4. `challenge`: Specifies the challenge type or references the challenge data file.
5. `variant`: Defines a specific variant or presentation style for the challenge.
6. `tasks`: Indicates the number of tasks or questions in this challenge.
7. `unlock_points`: The number of points required to unlock this challenge.
8. `position`: The challenge's position in the game's visual layout.

The `tasks` field can use the TaskPattern format, allowing for flexible task selection:
- Exact number: `tasks: 10`
- Range: `tasks: "5..15"`
- Random selection: `tasks: "10:random"` or `tasks: "10:1..20"`

This configuration system enables the creation of diverse and engaging challenges while maintaining a consistent structure for easy management and expansion of the game content.

== Create a New Challenge Dataset

To create a new challenge dataset, follow these steps:

* Create a new file in `src/assets/challenges/` for the challenge data like `src/assets/challenges/articles.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
include::../src/assets/challenges/articles.yml[lines=1..20]
----

* Add the challenge data to the level file like `src/assets/challenges/levels.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
include::../src/assets/challenges/level_a1.yml[lines=1..11]
----

* Add the challenge file `src/assets/challenges/articles.yml` to the level file `src/assets/challenges/level_a1.yml` to the level loader `src/model/level_loader.rs`

[source,rust]
----
include::../src/model/level_loader.rs[lines="14..17,44..56"]
----

== Create new Custom Challenge Design

To create a new custom challenge design, follow these steps:

* Create a new html file in `src/assets/challenges/html` for the challenge design like `src/assets/challenges/custom_articles.html`

[source,html]
----
include::../src/assets/challenges/html/custom_articles.html[]
----

* Create a new css file in `src/assets/challenges/css` for the challenge design like `src/assets/challenges/css/custom_articles.css`

[source,css]
----
include::../src/assets/challenges/css/custom_articles.css[]
----

* Create a new js file in `src/assets/challenges/js` for the challenge design like `src/assets/challenges/js/custom_articles.js`

[source,javascript]
----
include::../src/assets/challenges/js/custom_articles.js[]
----

* Add a new challenge data to the challenges folder like `src/assets/challenges/custom_articles.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
include::../src/assets/challenges/custom_articles.yml[lines=1..20]
----

* Update the level loader `src/model/level_loader.rs` to include the new challenge design

[source,rust]
----
include::../src/model/level_loader.rs[lines="70..84"]
----

* Add the new challenge design to the level file `src/assets/challenges/level_c1.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
include::../src/assets/challenges/level_c1.yml[lines=39..46]
----

== JavaScript Integration with konnektoren.js

The project uses a `window.konnektoren` object in JavaScript to handle challenge data and event handling for custom challenges. This section provides an overview of how this integration works.

=== Overview of `window.konnektoren`

When the application loads, `window.konnektoren` is initialized as a global JavaScript object. It contains two key components:

1. `challenge`: Stores the challenge data, which can be accessed as a plain JavaScript object.
2. `sendEvent`: A function that can be called to send challenge-related events from JavaScript to Rust.

==== Challenge Data

The `challenge` object holds various properties of the custom challenge. Here is an example of how the `challenge` object is structured:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "custom_articles",
  "name": "Artikel",
  "description": "Learn the articles of the German language",
  "html": "/assets/challenges/html/custom_articles.html",
  "css": "/assets/challenges/css/custom_articles.css",
  "js": "/assets/challenges/js/custom_articles.js",
  "i18n": "/assets/challenges/i18n/custom_articles.yml",
  "data": {
    "options": [
      { "id": 0, "name": "der" },
      { "id": 1, "name": "die" },
      { "id": 2, "name": "das" }
    ],
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Haus",
        "help": "Ich habe ein neues Haus gekauft.",
        "option": 2,
        "image": "fa-regular fa-house-chimney-window"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

You can access specific properties of the `challenge` object using the `.get()` method if `data` is stored as a `Map`. For example, to access the `options` and `questions`, use the following:

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(window.konnektoren.challenge.data);
const data = window.konnektoren.challenge.data;

// Accessing options and questions using .get() for Map
const firstOption = data.get("options")[0];
console.log(firstOption.name); // Output: "der"

const firstQuestion = data.get("questions")[0];
console.log(firstQuestion.question); // Output: "Haus"
----

Note: If the `data` is stored as a plain object, use dot notation instead:

[source,javascript]
----
const data = window.konnektoren.challenge.data;
const firstOption = data.options[0];
console.log(firstOption.name); // Output: "der"
----


==== Event Handling with `sendEvent`

`window.konnektoren` also exposes a `sendEvent` function that allows sending events from JavaScript to Rust. The possible events that can be sent include:

* `NextTask(index)`: Triggered when the user moves to the next task.
* `PreviousTask(index)`: Triggered when the user moves to the previous task.
* `SolvedCorrect(index)`: Triggered when the user answers a task correctly.
* `SolvedIncorrect(index)`: Triggered when the user answers a task incorrectly.
* `Finish(ChallengeResult)`: Triggered when the challenge is completed.

Example of sending an event from JavaScript:

[source,javascript]
----
window.konnektoren.sendEvent({
  type: "NextTask",
  index: 1
});
window.konnektoren.sendEvent({
    type: "Finish",
    result: {
        correct: 5,
        incorrect: 2,
        total: 7
    }
})
----

==== Translation with 'tr'

The `window.konnektoren` object also provides a `tr` function that can be used to translate text in the custom challenge. The `tr` function takes a key as an argument and returns the translated text.
The challenge data should contain a line for i18n that points to the translation file.

[source,yml]
----
i18n:
  "German Article Exercise":
    "de": "Deutsche Artikel Übung"
    "en": "German Article Exercise"
    "es": "Ejercicio de artículos en alemán"
    "cn": "德语冠词练习"
    "ua": "Німецька стаття вправа"
    "tr": "Almanca Artikel Egzersizi"
    "ar": "تمرين اللغة الألمانية"
  "Finish Exercise":
    "de": "Übung beenden"
    "en": "Finish Exercise"
    "es": "Terminar ejercicio"
    "cn": "完成练习"
    "ua": "Завершити вправу"
    "tr": "Egzersizi bitir"
    "ar": "انهاء التمرين"

== Achievements

Achievements are a way to reward players for their progress and engagement with the game. They are defined in a YAML file and evaluated based on various statistics tracked during gameplay.

=== Adding Achievements

To add new achievements, edit the `src/assets/achievements.yml` file. Each achievement is defined with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
achievements:
  - id: xp_master
    name: XP Master
    description: Earn 1000 XP
    icon: 🏆
    condition: "total_xp > 1000"
  - id: challenge_champion
    name: Challenge Champion
    description: Complete 50 challenges
    icon: 🏅
    condition: "total_challenges >= 50"
----

Key components of an achievement definition:

1. `id`: A unique identifier for the achievement.
2. `name`: The display name of the achievement.
3. `description`: A brief explanation of what the achievement represents.
4. `icon`: An emoji, Font Awesome icon class (prefixed with "fa-"), or image URL to represent the achievement visually.
5. `condition`: A string that defines the condition for unlocking the achievement.

=== Trackable Statistics

The following statistics can be used in achievement conditions:

1. `total_challenges`: The total number of challenges completed.
   - Usage: `"total_challenges >= 50"`

2. `average_performance`: The average performance across all challenges (as a percentage).
   - Usage: `"average_performance >= 90"`

3. `total_xp`: The total experience points earned.
   - Usage: `"total_xp > 1000"`

4. `completed_game_paths`: The number of game paths (levels) completed.
   - Usage: `"completed_game_paths >= 3"`

5. `perfect_challenges`: The number of challenges completed with a perfect score.
   - Usage: `"perfect_challenges >= 10"`

6. `different_challenge_types_completed`: The number of unique challenge types completed.
   - Usage: `"different_challenge_types_completed >= 5"`

=== Condition Syntax

The condition string uses a simple comparison syntax:

- Supported operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`
- The left side of the condition should be one of the trackable statistics.
- The right side should be a numeric value.

Examples:
[source,yaml]
----
condition: "total_xp > 1000"
condition: "average_performance >= 95"
condition: "completed_game_paths == 5"
----
